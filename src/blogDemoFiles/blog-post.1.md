# How I passed the AZ 204

April 14th, 2024

The AZ204 took me multiple tries to pass. It is a difficult test. Question struture is unique to the test and there are some sections you cannot go back and review. At the time I passed the test in 2023 there were multiple choice and multiple answer, fill in the blank, and a case-study like question. See the materials section for being prepared for what kind of questions are on the test. Having passed the Azure Developer Associate and the AWS Developer Associate exams I would call the Azure exam twice as difficult as compared to AWS.

It is important to know C# .NET since it is the primary language used on the test. It is important to practice the lab exercises in the microsoft content and use the CLI and the cloudshell to build and configure resources. There will be questions that involve code and the CLI commands.

My past experience with Azure before studying to take the exam was with Azure functions, API Management, Blob Storage and CosmosDB for about 6 months.

The most important part of studying was creating a study plan to study a consistent amount, and then take the real test after completing practice test at 90%.

## **Materials**

These are the resources I used to learn and practice skills for the AZ204 exam.

### **Microsoft content**

[Read and understand the exam structure and content covered](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/resources/study-guides/az-204)
[Documentation of modules](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-developer/?practice-assessment-type=certification#certification-prepare-for-the-exam)
[The .NET on Azure series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzdqO6jX8u4&list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oVSBX3Lde8owu6dSgZLIXfu)

### **Udemy Course**

### **Practice Tests**

[Microsoft's Practice Test](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-developer/practice/assessment?assessment-type=practice&assessmentId=35&practice-assessment-type=certification&source=docs) This format is different from the actual test

MeasureUp practice tests. I used MeasureUp Practice tests from a work subscription. They were decent but compare other practice test content to find something with positive reviews.

### **Flash cards**

[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) I used Anki flashcards on my desktop and phone to be able to memorize and retain Azure content. I would suggest making flash cards of the recap questions at the end of each module and use Anki's spaced repetition system. Watchout for Anki impersonators, there are some scam clones of Anki out there. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anki_(software)
