# How I passed the AZ 204

April 14th, 2024

The AZ204 took me multiple tries to pass. It is a difficult test. Question struture is unique to the test and there are some sections you cannot go back and review. At the time I took the test in 2023 there were multiple choice and multiple answer, fill in the blank, and a case-study like question. See the materials section for being prepared for what kind of questions are on the test.

It is important to know C# .NET since it is the primary language used on the test. It is important to practice the lab exercises in the microsoft content and use the CLI and the cloudshell to build and configure resources.
