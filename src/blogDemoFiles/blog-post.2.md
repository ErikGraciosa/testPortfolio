# How I passed the AWS Associate Developer Exam DVA-C02

April 15th, 2024

I passed the AWS Associate Developer Exam DVA-C02 on the first try in March of 2024. I spent about 200hrs studying in preparation. My prior on the job experience was about 6 months of using Lambda, S3, CosmosDB, IAM, and API Gateway. I had already passed the Azure Developer Course the year prior and was familiar with similar Microsoft cloud product offerings and their uses.

Overall, this test is multiple choice and sometimes multiple answer. In my opinion the format makes it less difficult than the Microsoft Azure Developer exam. There is no code but there are CLI questions in the AWS exam. My 200hrs of study were condensed into about 6 weeks and I was able to go through the Udemy course below and work through all the labs before starting to take practice tests. After taking a few of the practice tests my weakest domain was in security topics and I focused reviewing that domain.

I would emphasize once again to create a study plan and to schedule what you will be studying on each day and plan an estimated real exam date.

After I was passing the practice tests consistenly at 90% I took the real exam.

## **Materials**

These are the resources I used to learn and practice skills for the AWS exam.

### **AWS content**

### **Udemy Course**

[Course created by Stephane Maarek](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-developer-associate-dva-c01/)

### **Practice Tests**

[Jon Bonso's practice tests](https://portal.tutorialsdojo.com/courses/aws-certified-developer-associate-practice-exams/)

### **Flash cards**

[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) I used Anki flashcards on my desktop and phone to be able to memorize and retain AWS content. I would suggest making flash cards of the recap questions at the end of each module in Stephane Maarek's Udemy course to get familiar with the main concepts and use Anki's spaced repetition system. Watchout for Anki impersonators, there are some scams clones of Anki out there. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anki_(software)
